# Blackjack

### A Java program that simulates one of the most popular casino card games in the world

### **Objective:**

>To get a higher total in the numbered value of the cards in your hand than the dealer, 
without going over a count of 21.

### **How to Play:**

- A player will interact with the program by first making a bet with their available amount of betting chips. Minimum bet starts at $1.
- Two cards will then be dealt to both the player (face up) and the dealer (first face up, second face down), in alternating order.
- The player must decide whether to ***"Stand"***, ***"Hit"***, or ***"Double"***.
  - **"Stand"** means to stop at the current count with no additional cards being drawn.
  - **"Hit"** means to draw an additional card. If the player's count goes over 21, the player has "bust" and automatically loses the round.
  - **"Double"** means to "double down", which means you would like to increase your wager by the equivalent amount to your original bet, and take one additional card.
- When the player stands and completes their hand (without busting), the dealer's face down card will be revealed.
  - If the dealer's cards show a count within the range of 17 to 21, the dealer stands.
  - If the dealer's cards show a count of 16 or less, the dealer will continue to draw cards until either the count is within the range of 17 to 21, or the dealer busts, whichever comes first.
  
  
- **Round Result:**
  - If the player has a higher final count than the dealer or the dealer busts, then the player wins and an amount of chips equal to the player's wager will be rewarded.
  - If the player has a final count equal to the dealer's, then the round is considered a tie or a "push".

### **Card Values:**
- Cards 2 through 10 have a numbered value equal to its face value.
- Face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) have a numbered value of 10.
- Aces can be either 1 or 11, depending on the situation and whichever is more beneficial for your current hand.
- Card suits do not affect the game.

### **Rules:**
- Blackjack (10 or face card + Ace) pays out 3:2.
- Dealer stands on a count of within the range of 17 to 21.
- Dealer stands on soft 17.

### **Target Audience:**
- Anyone who would like to learn about one of the most popular casino card games in the world
- This is also a good training ground for gameplay before heading out to the casino and gambling with real dollars!

### **Rationale for Project:**
I created this project because I am genuinely fascinated by this game and believe that this is one of the few casino games out there that requires knowledge of probability and logic. There is a well-documented "Basic Strategy" that has been developed over the years based on card probabilities. If a player were to follow closely to this strategy, they could significantly reduce the house edge to 0.5% (vs. ~5% in roulette, for example), making it one of the fairest casino games in existence. 

### **User Stories**
**Phase 1**
- As a user, I want to be able to make the decision to hit (i.e. draw additional cards / adding X to Y) or stand (i.e. do not draw any more cards).
- As a user, I want to be able to view my balance after the current round is complete.
- As a user, I want to be able to play a new round after the current round is complete.
- As a user, I want to be able to change my bets each round (i.e. bets for each round of play is independent).
- As a user, I want to be able to double down on my bets on hands where I believe I have a strong chance of beating the dealer.

**Phase 2**
- As a user, I want to be able to save the current round of Blackjack to file (similar to "holding" a seat at a casino).
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load the saved round of Blackjack or start a new round.

### **Phase 4, Task 2**
Sample event log:
Wed Mar 30 19:58:40 PDT 2022
Player starts with a J of Diamonds and a 3 of Clubs for a count of 13.

Wed Mar 30 19:58:40 PDT 2022
Dealer starts with a A of Hearts and a 4 of Spades for a count of 15.

Wed Mar 30 19:58:42 PDT 2022
Player hits a 6 of Spades for a count of 19.

Wed Mar 30 19:58:43 PDT 2022
Player stands on a count of 19.

Wed Mar 30 19:58:43 PDT 2022
Dealer hits a J of Hearts for a count of 15.

Wed Mar 30 19:58:43 PDT 2022
Dealer hits a Q of Hearts for a count of 25.

Wed Mar 30 19:58:43 PDT 2022
Dealer busts on a count of 25.

Wed Mar 30 19:58:43 PDT 2022
Both hands cleared to begin a new round.

### **Phase 4, Task 3**
- The Player class could be changed so that there is an abstract User class, and both Player and a new Dealer class would extend the User class so that the hierarchy / structure is cleaner. There would be a lot of duplicate code in Player and Dealer that could be abstracted and even implemented in the User class.
- Building on the previous point, Card could have an aggregation relationship with the abstract User class as a Card could be interpreted to be "part of" a User.
- Making all methods robust via incorporating exceptions; the bet input was made robust but there could be other methods that could be made more robust, such as ensuring that a hand is a non-empty list before doing any actions on it. That way there would also not be any "requires" clauses in the method specifications.
